Although not very obvious, it is actually possible to perform a whole word search in your eclipse workspace.

To do so, click on “Search” (from the menu) and then “File” from the sub-menu.

Make sure to select “Regular expression” and then you can use any regex expression you can come up with, for the whole word it’s \byourword\b so for example to search for johny you will write \bjohny\b

There’s lots of info about regular expression on the internet , you can perform anything with these expressions and they can get pretty complicated!

Enjoy :)
